## üõ†Ô∏è Project description

This project aims to show how React can be used to create a web application that communicates with an external API and displays dynamic data. The API used is [The Movie Database (TMDB)], which provides a wide variety of information about movies, series, actors, etc. The application allows to search movies by title and filters movies by genre.

## Features

- Search movies by title, using the TMDB API.
- Filter movies by genre, using TMDB API parameters.
- View details of each movie, such as title and short description, using the TMDB API.
- Navigate between result pages, using TMDB API pagination.
- Display error or void messages when no results are found or when a problem occurs with the API.

To use the application, you can follow the steps below:

- Type the title of the movie you want to search in the text field and press the search button.
- Select the genre of the movies to be filtered from the drop-down menu.
